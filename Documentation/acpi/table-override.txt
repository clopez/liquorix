CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_OVERRIDE_INITRAMFS provides a mechanism for
the user to add table images to the initramfs for loading at
runtime. Tables used before expansion of the initramfs may not
be replaced. Fortunately this list is small and the one most
typically used, DSDT, is not one of them.

In order to override a table, the image must be placed in the root
of the initramfs with a filename of <table-name>.aml (e.g. DSDT.aml).

As the ACPI subsystem initializes, it will load the tables into memory
and override them as the tables are needed.

This option takes precedence over the in-kernel method provided by
the ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT config option.

When to use these methods is described in detail on the
Linux/ACPI home page:
http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/overridingDSDT.php

Documentation/initramfs-add-dsdt.sh is provided for convenience
for use with the CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_OVERRIDE_INITRAMFS method.
